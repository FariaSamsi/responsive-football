                        Copa América (English: America Cup) or CONMEBOL Copa América, known until 1975 as the South
                        American
                        Football Championship (Campeonato Sudamericano de Fútbol in Spanish and Copa Sul-Americana de
                        Futebol in Portuguese),[1] is the main men's football tournament contested among national teams
                        from
                        South America. It is the oldest still-running international football competition, as well as the
                        third most watched in the world.[2] The competition determines the champions of South
                        America.[2][3][4] Since the 1990s, teams from North America and Asia have also been invited to
                        compete.

                        Since 1993, the tournament has generally featured 12 teams—all 10 CONMEBOL teams and two
                        additional
                        teams from other confederations. Mexico participated in every tournament between 1993 and 2016,
                        with
                        one additional team drawn from CONCACAF, except for 1999, when AFC team Japan filled out the
                        12-team
                        roster, and 2019, which featured Japan and Qatar. The 2016 version of the event, Copa América
                        Centenario, featured 16 teams, with six teams from CONCACAF in addition to the 10 from
                        CONMEBOL.[5]
                        Mexico's two runner-up finishes are the highest for a non-CONMEBOL side.

                        Eight of the ten CONMEBOL national teams have won the tournament at least once in its 47
                        stagings
                        since the event's inauguration in 1916, with only Ecuador and Venezuela yet to win. Argentina
                        and
                        Uruguay have the most championships in the tournament's history, with 15 cups each. Argentina,
                        which
                        hosted the inaugural edition in 1916, has hosted the tournament the most times (nine). The
                        United
                        States is the only non-CONMEBOL country to host, having hosted the event in 2016. On three
                        occasions
                        (in 1975, 1979, and 1983), the tournament was held in multiple South American countries.
